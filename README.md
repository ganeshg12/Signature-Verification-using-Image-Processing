# Signature-Verification-using-Image-Processing
This project is an implementation of signature verification using image processing techniques. The aim of this project is to develop an automated system that can verify the authenticity of handwritten signatures.
## Features:
1. Image preprocessing: The system performs image preprocessing techniques such as noise removal, Resizing, Filtering Binarization, Thinning, Skeletonization, Rotation for Skew Correction, Cropping, and normalization to ensure the signatures are in a suitable format for further analysis.
2. Feature extraction: Various feature extraction methods are employed to capture the distinctive characteristics of signatures, including Normalized Signature area, Aspect Ratio, Horizontal and Vertical Projections, Centre of Gravity or Centroid, and many more.
3. Verification using Extracted Features: Once the Features are extracted, they are stored in a Vector and need to fix minimum error threshold values for each feature implemented using which it classifies genuine signatures. The more images this step is applied to the more accurate our algorithm becomes.
## Potential applications:
* Forensic analysis: Signature verification can be used in forensic investigations to determine the authenticity of signatures on legal documents or contracts.
* Banking and finance: Banks and financial institutions can employ this technology to detect fraudulent activities by verifying signatures on checks or transaction documents.
* Identity verification: Signature verification can be integrated into verification systems to enhance security and prevent identity theft.
By open-sourcing this project, I aim to encourage collaboration and further research in the field of signature verification. 

Just so you know, while this project provides a foundation for signature verification, it may require customization or additional development to suit specific use cases or datasets.
